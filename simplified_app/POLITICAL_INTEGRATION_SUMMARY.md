# Political Analysis Integration Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated the src version's political-focused document analysis capabilities into the simplified_app version. The simplified app now uses the same political campaign material analysis prompts and taxonomy mapping as the main src application.

## Changes Made

### 1. PromptManager Updates (`services/prompt_manager.py`)

- **System Prompt**: Changed from general document analysis to political campaign material specialization
- **Document Types**: Updated from general types to political-specific types:
  - Old: `['report', 'letter', 'form', 'brochure', 'manual', 'presentation', 'article', 'memo', 'invoice', 'contract', 'other']`
  - New: `['mailer', 'digital ad', 'handout', 'poster', 'letter', 'brochure']`
- **Classification Categories**: Updated from general to political categories:
  - Old: `['informational', 'promotional', 'instructional', 'transactional', 'legal', 'administrative', 'analytical']`
  - New: `['GOTV', 'attack', 'comparison', 'endorsement', 'issue', 'biographical']`
- **Entity Fields**: Updated to political entities:
  - Old: `organization_name`, `author_name`, `creation_date`
  - New: `client_name`, `opponent_name`, `creation_date`, `survey_question`, `file_identifier`
- **Document Analysis Fields**: Updated to political context:
  - Added: `campaign_type`, `election_year`
  - Updated: `document_tone` to political tones (`positive`, `negative`, `neutral`, `informational`, `contrast`)
- **Text Extraction**: Updated to political messaging:
  - `main_message` (headline/slogan)
  - `supporting_text` (secondary messages)
  - `call_to_action` (voter instructions)
- **Design Elements**: Updated to political design analysis:
  - `theme` (patriotic, conservative, progressive, etc.)
  - `mail_piece_type` (postcard, letter, brochure, etc.)
  - `geographic_location`, `target_audience`, `campaign_name`
- **Communication Focus**: Updated to political messaging:
  - `primary_issue`, `secondary_issues`
  - `messaging_strategy` (attack, positive, comparison, etc.)
  - `audience_persuasion`

### 2. AI Service Updates (`services/ai_service.py`)

- **Keyword Extraction**: Enhanced to handle political analysis structure
  - Added support for `campaign_type`, `document_tone` extraction
  - Added support for `client_name`, `opponent_name` entity extraction
  - Enhanced taxonomy keyword mapping extraction
  - Added communication focus keyword extraction
- **Fallback Analysis**: Updated to use political document structure
  - Default `document_type`: "brochure"
  - Default `campaign_type`: "general"
  - Default `category`: "informational"

### 3. Database Compatibility

- **Existing Schema**: No changes needed - JSON fields already support political data
- **Document Model**: Already flexible enough to handle political analysis structure
- **Taxonomy Model**: Already supports the political taxonomy structure

## Key Features Now Available

## Testing Results

### Database Compatibility Tests

✅ **Database Schema**: PASS - Existing JSON fields support political data structure
✅ **Enhanced Analysis Storage**: PASS - Successfully stores and retrieves political analysis data
✅ **JSON Field Flexibility**: PASS - Handles complex nested political analysis structures

### Key Test Results

- Successfully stored unified political analysis with campaign-specific fields
- Successfully stored modular political analysis with multiple specialized sections
- Successfully handled taxonomy keyword mappings with political terms
- Verified JSON field flexibility for various political analysis structures

## Example Analysis Output

For a political document like "Carnes G05 Illegal Housing Contrast - PRESS.pdf", the system now generates:

```json
{
  "document_analysis": {
    "summary": "Political advertisement attacking opponent on housing policy",
    "document_type": "mailer",
    "campaign_type": "general",
    "election_year": 2025,
    "document_tone": "negative"
  },
  "classification": {
    "category": "attack",
    "subcategory": "Housing Policy",
    "rationale": "Document criticizes opponent's housing policies"
  },
  "entities": {
    "client_name": "Carnes Campaign",
    "opponent_name": "[Opponent Name]",
    "creation_date": "2025-07-07"
  },
  "keyword_mappings": [
    {
      "verbatim_term": "illegal housing",
      "mapped_primary_category": "Policy Issues & Topics",
      "mapped_subcategory": "Public Safety & Justice",
      "mapped_canonical_term": "Immigration"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Political Analysis**: Documents are now analyzed with political campaign context
2. **Better Keyword Mapping**: Keywords are mapped to political taxonomy terms
3. **Campaign-Specific Categories**: Uses political categories instead of generic ones
4. **Enhanced Entity Extraction**: Identifies candidates, opponents, and political entities
5. **Political Design Analysis**: Analyzes campaign materials with political design context

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing documents in the database remain unaffected
- JSON structure is flexible enough to handle both old and new analysis formats
- No database migrations required
- Existing functionality continues to work

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Political Documents**: Upload actual campaign materials to verify analysis quality
2. **Taxonomy Initialization**: Load the political taxonomy into the database
3. **UI Updates**: Consider updating the UI to display political-specific fields
4. **Search Enhancement**: Leverage political categories for better search functionality

## Files Modified

- `simplified_app/services/prompt_manager.py` - Updated all prompts for political analysis
- `simplified_app/services/ai_service.py` - Enhanced keyword extraction for political data
- `simplified_app/POLITICAL_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Database Schema

No changes required - existing schema already supports the political analysis structure through JSON fields.
